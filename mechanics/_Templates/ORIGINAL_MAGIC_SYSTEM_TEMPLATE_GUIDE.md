# Original Magic System Compendium Template

Import `original_magic_system_ability_compendium_template.json` from the
Ability & Power Compendium. Importing replaces the current canonical ability
library, so export the campaign's existing library first if it must be kept.

The template contains eight editable archetypes:

1. **Magical Foundation** defines universal access, perception, limits, and
   impossibilities.
2. **Basic Invocation** demonstrates costs, mastery tiers, and upgrade branches.
3. **Sustained Ward** demonstrates maintained powers and disruption.
4. **Counter Technique** demonstrates reactions and structured counter tags.
5. **Transformation** demonstrates a persistent state with benefits and
   liabilities.
6. **Forbidden Ritual** demonstrates a Lore Check gate.
7. **Focus-Bound Power** demonstrates an inventory-granted ability.
8. **Enemy Signature Action** demonstrates an Enemy Compendium reference.

## Campaign Terminology

The file uses the version 2 document format. Its top-level `terminology` block
changes the labels shown by the Engine while the stable internal keys remain
unchanged:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "terminology": {
    "originLabels": {
      "innate": "Bloodline Gift",
      "trained": "Discipline",
      "spell": "Invocation"
    },
    "categoryLabels": {
      "active": "Technique",
      "ritual": "Grand Working"
    }
  },
  "abilities": []
}
```

Rename only the values on the right. Keep keys such as `innate`, `trained`,
`active`, and `ritual` unchanged so the Engine can retain its cross-system
behavior. Any omitted or empty label falls back to the default terminology.
Legacy compendiums containing only an array of abilities remain importable.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Export any existing ability library as a backup.
2. Import the JSON template.
3. Open the **Terminology** tab or edit the file's `terminology` block to name
   origins and categories for the campaign.
4. Edit **Magical Foundation** first. Decide:
   - who receives magic and how;
   - what resource or cost constrains it;
   - how magic is perceived;
   - what magic cannot do;
   - what suppresses or counters it.
5. Rename the shared `template-*` interaction tags to terms meaningful to the
   setting. Use the same spelling wherever abilities should interact.
6. Duplicate **Basic Invocation** for each common technique. Keep each entry
   focused on one durable capability.
7. Replace every sentence beginning with `Replace` and remove the `Template`
   tags when an entry is finished.
8. Link **Focus-Bound Power** to a real inventory item. It will remain inactive
   until linked, carried, and equipped.
9. Link **Enemy Signature Action** from an enemy's optional action.
10. Give **Forbidden Ritual** a precise lore-verification note, run Lore Check,
   review the evidence, and save only when satisfied.
11. Assign learned abilities from the Characters tab. Item powers and enemy
    actions should remain cross-system references rather than permanent player
    assignments.

## Field Guide

- **Category** answers: how does the ability behave?
- **Origin** answers: where does the ability come from?
- **Effect** states the authoritative fictional or mechanical change.
- **Activation** states what must happen before the effect begins.
- **Costs** state what is paid, how much, when, and under what condition.
- **Limitations** prevent the ability from becoming an unlimited solution.
- **Counters** explain responses in plain language.
- **Interaction Tags** identify what the ability produces or participates in.
- **Counter Tags** identify interaction tags this ability opposes.
- **Mastery Ladder** defines ordered levels of competence.
- **Upgrade Branches** define optional specialization with prerequisites.
- **Outcome Guidance** tells the narrator how to handle edge cases without
  inventing new rules.
- **GM Notes** hold implementation or adjudication notes not intended as the
  public-facing description.

## Design Checks

Before considering the system ready, make sure it answers:

- Can players predict what magic can and cannot do?
- Does every powerful effect have a meaningful cost, setup, exposure, or limit?
- Are counters observable enough for characters to act on?
- Are persistent effects and transformations easy to track?
- Is progression an increase in options or control, rather than unrestricted
  numerical escalation?
- Are lore-only powers blocked until their claims are verified?
- Are item powers lost naturally when the granting item is unavailable?
- Do enemy abilities follow the same canonical rules as player abilities?
