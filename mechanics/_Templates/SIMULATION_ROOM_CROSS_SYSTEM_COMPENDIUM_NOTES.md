# Simulation Room Cross-System Ability Compendium

Import `simulation_room_cross_system_ability_compendium.json` from the Ability &
Power Compendium Library.

This is an experimental variant of the faithful 54-skill Simulation Room file.
It contains 60 definitions and deliberately exercises every Phase 6 origin.

The version 2 `terminology` block gives those origins Simulation Room labels,
including **Core Trait**, **Nikke Skill**, **Equipment Power**, **Rapture
Action**, and **Simulation Grant**. The labels can be changed in the file or
from the Compendium's **Terminology** tab without altering the stable internal
classification.

## Origin Distribution

- Trained: 43
- Innate: 6
- Inventory Power: 7
- Enemy Action: 1
- Lore-Granted: 1
- Spell: 1
- Other: 1

## Reclassified Catalogue Skills

The original names, IDs, effects, prerequisites, and Rank 1-5 ladders are
preserved.

- Frame-, sensor-, or embodied-reflex abilities such as `Reinforced Frame` and
  `Close Quarters Reflexes` are classified as Innate.
- Weapon-system mechanics such as `Shell Discipline`, `Heavy Feed`, and
  `Fragmentation Pattern` are classified as Inventory Powers.

Inventory Powers must be linked to the correct weapon inventory record after
import. Until linked, carried, and equipped, they are intentionally unavailable
for prompt injection.

## Original Provisional Abilities

These six entries were created for cross-system testing and are tagged
`Experimental`, `Original Ability`, and `Player Review Required`:

- `NIMPH Threat Reflex` - Innate reaction.
- `Graviton Lure Module` - Inventory Power.
- `Rapture Harmonic Scream` - Enemy Action.
- `Mirror Bloom Protocol` - Lore-Granted transformation, blocked until Lore
  Check verification.
- `Code Invocation: Glass Garden` - Spell-origin simulation code. It does not
  claim supernatural magic exists outside the Simulation Room.
- `Simulation Override: Reset Vector` - Other/system permission, with prompt
  injection disabled by default.

Review, edit, or remove the provisional entries before treating the file as
campaign canon.

## Compatibility

The 54 established catalogue entries retain their previous IDs, so existing
character ownership records continue to resolve. The Burst Skills also remain
present and enabled for catalogue fidelity, with the existing warning that the
prior solo Simulation Room kernel disabled Burst Skills, Burst Gauge, and Full
Burst.

Importing replaces the current canonical library. Export the existing library
before testing this variant.
